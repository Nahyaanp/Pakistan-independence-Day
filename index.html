        <h2>How Pakistan Gained Independence</h2>
        <p>Pakistan achieved independence on August 14, 1947, through a complex and momentous process that involved the partition of British India, driven by the resolute demand for a separate Muslim state spearheaded by the All-India Muslim League under the leadership of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, amidst the backdrop of intense political negotiations, the declining influence of the British Empire post-World War II, and widespread communal unrest that highlighted the need for distinct national identities for Hindus and Muslims, culminating in the creation of Pakistan as a sovereign nation and the simultaneous partition of India, which led to significant demographic shifts and communal violence.</p>

                <p>Muhammad Ali Jinnah, also known as Quaid-e-Azam (The Great Leader), was the driving force behind the creation of Pakistan. As the leader of the All-India Muslim League, he advocated for the rights of Muslims in India and spearheaded the movement for a separate Muslim state.</p>
                <p>Jinnah’s vision for Pakistan was one of a secular and progressive state where people of all faiths could live in harmony. His leadership and relentless efforts culminated in the creation of Pakistan on August 14, 1947. Jinnah served as Pakistan's first Governor-General until his death in 1948.</p>
                <p>His legacy lives on as the "Father of the Nation" in Pakistan, and his principles of unity, faith, and discipline continue to inspire generations.</p>
